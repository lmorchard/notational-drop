I like [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/). I like [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). 
Sometimes, I keep my notes from Notational Velocity in Dropbox.

This is an attempt to use [dropbox-js](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js)
to build a Notational Velocity inspired notetaking web app.

Someday, this may grow up to be an installable [Open Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps) 
and work in [FirefoxOS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/).

Or, I may get bored and wander off before it's done. But, the code's here, at least!
